# QuotesApp
It is a mobile application that displays quotes. If you scroll down the screen, the quote will be refreshed as you can see in the second picture, and the "Change Quote" button that you can see at the bottom of the page also has the same function.

## Getting Started

In your terminal change into project folder that you created then run:
```bash
yarn install
```
to install required dependencies.

After installing run :
```bash
yarn start
```
This opens the React Native bundler, which gets your code ready to be run on a mobile device.

Install the **expo** app on your mobile device from the App Store or Google Play Store. Scan the QR code from the React Native Bundler on your phone.
